This box is designed to replace the original mobo enclosure of the Ender 3 v2 in order to add a Raspberry pi 3, two step-down and two relays inside the printer.

This mod is thought for make the printer controlled from remote exploiting the Wi-Fi connection of the raspberry pi, for this reason fast access to the SD card is not provided.

*The box requires removing also the drawer*

## Compatibility

This box is designed for the `Creality Ender 3 v2`, but it could be compatible also with `Creality Ender 3` and `Creality Ender3 Pro` after some minor changes.

## Components

In order to assemble the box you have to print:

- `box_sx` (to contain the printer's motherboard and one relay)
- `box_dx` (to contain the Raspberry pi 3, two step-down and one relay)
- `cover`x2 (to cover the two boxes)

### Mounting components

- `t-nut M3`x8 (for the printer's frame profiles, you can also [print them](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3050607))
- `screw M3 medium`x8 (for the t-nuts)
- `threaded insert M3`x25 (8 for the covers and 17 for the electrical components)
- `screw M3 short`x25 (8 for the covers and 17 for the electrical components)
